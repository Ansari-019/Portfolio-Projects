--Looking covid 19 data set

select location,date, total_cases, total_deaths,population
from `portfolio-project-1-344806.Covid19.covidDeaths`
order by 1,2

-- 1.Looking at Total Cases Vs Total Deaths in our country (India)

select location,date, total_cases, total_deaths,(total_deaths/total_cases)*100 as DeathPercentage
from `portfolio-project-1-344806.Covid19.covidDeaths`
where location = 'India'
order by 1,2

-- 2.Looking at Total Cases vs Population
-- shows what percentage of population got Covid

select location,date, total_cases, population,(total_deaths/population)*100 as Percentage_Population_Infecte
from `portfolio-project-1-344806.Covid19.covidDeaths`
order by 1,2

-- 3.Looking at Countries with Highest Infection RAte compared to Population

select location, population,MAX(total_cases) as Highest_Infection_count, Max(total_deaths/population)*100 as Percentage_Population_Infected
from `portfolio-project-1-344806.Covid19.covidDeaths`
Group by location, population
order by Percentage_Population_Infected desc

-- 4. Showing Countries with highest death count per Population

select location, Max(Total_deaths) as Total_death_count
from `portfolio-project-1-344806.Covid19.covidDeaths`
where continent is not null
Group by location
order by Total_death_count desc

-- 5. Let's break Things down by continent

select continent, Max(Total_deaths) as Total_death_count
from `portfolio-project-1-344806.Covid19.covidDeaths`
where continent is not null
Group by continent
order by Total_death_count desc



-- 6. Showing continents with the highest death count per population

select continent, Max(Total_deaths) as Total_death_count
from `portfolio-project-1-344806.Covid19.covidDeaths`
where continent is not null
Group by continent
order by Total_death_count desc

-- 7. Global Numbers

select date, Sum(new_cases) as total_cases, Sum(new_deaths)as total_deaths, Sum(new_deaths)/Sum(new_cases)*100 as DeathPercentage
from `portfolio-project-1-344806.Covid19.covidDeaths`
where continent is not null
group by date
order by 1,2

-- 8. Looking at Total population vs vaccinations

Select dea.continent, dea.location, dea.date, dea.population, vac.new_vaccinations
from `portfolio-project-1-344806.Covid19.covidDeaths` dea
join  `portfolio-project-1-344806.Covid19.vaccination_data` vac 
    on dea.location = vac.location
    and dea.date = vac.date
where dea.continent is not null 
order by 2,3
